### Progressive Web Applications Challenge


For this challenge, we were given starter code related to PWA's. The task was to finish building a text editor that runs in the browser. We used a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. We needed to implement some methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.
